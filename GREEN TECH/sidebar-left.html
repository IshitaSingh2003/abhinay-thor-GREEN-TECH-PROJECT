					<h1 class="page-title">Now lets begin the project</h1>
					<h2>Step -1 </h2>
				</header>
				<p>Prepare your two different soil muds. Start preparing your first soil for the first microbial fuel cell.</p>
				<p>Place a plastic strainer or colander over a large mixing bowl.
					Measure a total of about 2 cups (about 500 milliliters [mL]) of your soil into the strainer. Gently shake the strainer over the bowl so that the soil is strained and any small, hard particles (such as rocks, pebbles, twigs, etcetera) are removed from the soil. You will likely need to be patient; it may take several minutes to strain the soil. When you are done, you should have about 200 g of fine, sifted soil in the bowl.</p>
				<p>Add distilled water and mix it in until your topsoil mud feels like cookie dough. Add more water if the mud is too crumbly, or add more topsoil if the mixture feels too wet.
					When you have prepared your soil mud, set it aside and wash your hands.</p>

				<h2>Step -2</h2>
				<p>Carefully take the MFC pieces out of the box and lay them out. Identify the different components and use masking tape and a permanent marker to label both devices with one soil type each (for example "forest soil" or "garden soil")</p>
				<p>Put on the gloves that came with the MFCs and start assembling the first microbial fuel cell.
					Take out the green and orange wires that came with the MFC electrodes. Bend each wire where the plastic part ends so that each wire is now at a 90° angle (shaped like a capital "L"), as shown in the video above.</p>

                <h3>Safety Note</h3>
				<blockquote>Remove the MFC anode from its bag. (The anode is the thinner, black, felt-like circle.)
					Safety Note: The MFC's cathode and anode (its electrodes) are made of a conductive material called graphite fiber. Do not put the cathode or anode near electronics or power plugs, and do not disperse the fibers in the air, as the fibers will cause electrical shortages when in contact with electronics.
					</blockquote>
				<p>Straighten the metal part of the green wire and carefully insert it into the anode, as shown in Figure . Make sure the wire goes straight and does not poke out on the top or bottom sides of the anode.</p>
				<div style="text-align: center;">

				  </div>
				  
				<h2>Step -3</h2>
				<p>Repeat steps 6 and 7 using the cathode (the thicker, black, felt-like circle) and the orange wire (which is shorter than the green wire).
					Take the soil mud of your first soil type that you prepared in step 2 and use it to fill the first vessel up to the line next to the "1" on the plastic vessel (marking 1 centimeter [cm]). Once filled, pat the mud so that its surface is smooth.
					Tip: You may want to cover the surface you are working on with old newspapers to prevent mud from getting on it.
					When you are finished, rinse the mud off your gloves and dry them (but do not take them off yet).
					Put the anode on top of the mud in the vessel, as shown in Figure 4</p>
					<div style="text-align: center;">

						<img src="Screen Shot 2021-12-14 at 12.22.08 PM.png">
					  
					  </div>
				<h2>Step -4</h2>
				<p>Use more soil mud to fill the vessel up to the line next to the "5" mark (marking 5 cm). Once filled, again pat the mud so that its surface is smooth.
					Run the green wire along the side of the vessel.
					Rinse the mud off your gloves and dry them.
					Gently place the cathode on top of the mud and press it as flat as you can, as shown in Figure 5.
					The orange wire from the cathode should be sticking out of the top side.
					Do not let any mud or liquid cover the top of the cathode.
					It is best to arrange the cathode so that its orange wire is about 1–2 cm to the left of the green wire.
					Let the mud rest in the vessel for a few minutes. Then carefully pour off any excess liquid.</p>
					<div style="text-align: center;">

						<img src="Screen Shot 2021-12-14 at 12.27.07 PM.png">
					  
					  </div>
				<p>Use a clean paper towel or rag to wipe any mud off the vessel's rim. Then take off your gloves.
					Take the white plastic lid and pass the wires through the small holes in the lid. Arrange the wires so that the orange wire is on the left and the green wire is on the right when the semicircular indentation on the lid is facing the front. Then carefully snap the lid onto the plastic vessel.</p>
				<p>Take out the hacker board (the small green circuit). Attach it into the lid's rectangular indentation.
					Locate the "+" and "-" ports (holes) on the hacker board. Plug the cathode's wire (orange) into the "+" port and the anode's wire (green) into the "-" port.
					Locate ports 1 and 2 on the hacker board. Plug the black/blue capacitor (the small, cylindrical item with two longer metal prongs) into these ports. The black/blue capacitor's longer prong should go into port 1 and the shorter prong into port 2. Note: The orientation of the capacitor is important. If you reverse the short and long prongs, it will not work and might even damage the capacitor. You may need to bend the capacitor's longer end slightly so that the capacitor's prongs fit into the ports well.</p>
				<h2>Step-5</h2>
				<p>Plug the red LED below the capacitor into ports 5 and 6 (ports 3 and 4 will remain empty). The LED's longer prong should go into port 5 and the shorter prong into port 6. Note: The LED will only work if inserted in this orientation. If you accidentally reverse the prongs, the LED will not light up. You may need to bend the LED's longer end slightly so that the LED's prongs fit into the ports well.
					Make sure that the wires, capacitor, and LED are all securely in place. The assembled hacker board on the top of the MFC should now look like Figure</p>
					<div style="text-align: center;">

					  </div>
				<p>After assembling the first MFC, prepare your second soil type and set up the second microbial fuel cell using your second soil type starting at step 2.
					Once both microbial fuel cells are assembled, set the MFCs indoors, at normal room temperature (about 19–25° Celsius [C], or 66–77° Fahrenheit [F]), in a place where they will not be disturbed. The MFCs should remain in the same location the entire time after you set them up because if they are moved, this could disrupt the growth of the bacteria. It should take 3–7 days before the red LEDs on the hacker board start blinking, but you will start taking measurements before that, as described in the next section. Note: Temperature variations can cause changes in the power output of the microbial fuel cells due to different bacteria activities.</p>
